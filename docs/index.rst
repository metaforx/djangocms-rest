*Headless content delivery with Django CMS for modern, typed frontend apps.*

djangocms-rest lets you use `Django CMS <https://www.Django-cms.org/>`_ as a headless backend for modern, typed frontend applications, while preserving the intuitive Django CMS editing interface. This makes it possible to build Django apps that combine CMS-driven content with decoupled frontend frameworks.

djangocms-rest exposes Django CMS content through a read-only REST API. It is based on the `Django REST framework <https://www.Django-rest-framework.org/>`_ and provides OpenAPI 3 schema generation and a browsable API via `DRF Spectacular <https://github.com/tfranzel/drf-spectacular>`_.
