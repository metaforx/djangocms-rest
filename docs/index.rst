*Headless content delivery with django CMS for modern, typed frontend apps.*

djangocms-rest lets you use `django CMS <https://www.django-cms.org/>`_ as a headless backend for modern, typed frontend applications, while preserving the intuitive django CMS editing interface. This makes it possible to build Django apps that combine CMS-driven content with decoupled frontend frameworks.

djangocms-rest exposes django CMS content through a read-only REST API. It is based on the `Django REST framework <https://www.django-rest-framework.org/>`_ and provides OpenAPI 3 schema generation and a browsable API via `DRF Spectacular <https://github.com/tfranzel/drf-spectacular>`_.


Motivation
----------
Development has shifted more towards decoupled frontend apps due to easier scalability, the ability to serve multiple digital channels and work in specialized teams.
**djangocms-rest** provides a solution that serves both Django app content and Django CMS content via DRF, while preserving the intuitive Django CMS editing interface.

ðŸ‘‰ **No need for yet another tech stack.**
